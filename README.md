## How Increased Bike Share Infrastucture Influenced a Historic Decline in Toronto Bicycle Thefts

In the past decade, cycling has become a prominent mode of transportation in Toronto. By 2019, around 75 percent of households in the city owned a bicycle, and more than 40% of people reported using their bike for non-recreational purposes such as commuting to school or the office (City of Toronto, 2019). Despite being the safest city in Canada due to its low crime density (Mazloum, 2024), bike theft is a significant issue. Between 2010 and 2024, residents of Toronto faced a total financial loss of $33,704,466 CAD from bike theft. 2024 has seen the lowest number of bike thefts since 2013 and this analysis aims to explore the reason behind this historical decline.
